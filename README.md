## Javascript /typeScript Interview Questions

1. Asynchronous JavaScript:
  - Promises: Understand how to handle asynchronous operations gracefully.
Async/Await: Learn this modern approach to asynchronous code which makes your asynchronous code look more like traditional synchronous code.
Callbacks: Fundamental for asynchronous programming, though less preferred now due to "callback hell".

2. Functional Programming Concepts:
  - First-Class Functions: Understanding that functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
Pure Functions, Side Effects, and State Mutation: Concepts essential for writing clean, maintainable, and predictable code.
Closures: Understanding how an inner function has access to the outer functionâ€™s variables and the implications of this.


3. Advanced Techniques and Concepts:
   - Currying and Partial Application: Techniques for working with functions and improving code reusability.
Memoization: Optimization technique to speed up function execution by storing results of expensive function calls.
Prototypal Inheritance: Understanding the prototype chain, and how objects inherit properties and methods.
Design Patterns: Learning patterns like Module, Singleton, Observer, Factory, etc., for solving common design problems.
4. Error Handling and Debugging:
   - Exception handling with try...catch.
   - Understanding and using JavaScript's debugging tools.
5. Advanced DOM Manipulation:
  - Event Bubbling and Capturing: Understanding how events propagate through the DOM.
  - Document Fragments and performance considerations when interacting with the DOM.
  - Custom Events: Creating and dispatching custom event types.
6. ES6 and Beyond Features:
  - Understanding the latest ECMAScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, spread/rest operators, destructuring, ES6 modules, and more.
7. Browser APIs and Web Technologies:
  - WebSockets for real-time communication.
Service Workers for offline capabilities and background tasks.
WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication.
